# Object Detection Using MSER

Maximally Stable Extremal Regions is a feature detector and extracts salient objects from an image as a number of covariant regions know as MSERs. And this can be used to detect and extract regions of interest from an image. The object can then be extracted from these regions of interest by seperating them from the background on the basis of the difference in saturation of the foreground and background in the HSV colour space

### Prerequisites
OpenCV library for C++ Which can be downloaded from here http://opencv.org/releases.html
This code was written and compiled on the Eclispse IDE

### Deployment
The file path to the image has to be specified, to run multiple images at the same time numbered images were used.
